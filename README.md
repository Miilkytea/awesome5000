# Welcome to the Island of the Gorgons!    
  

  You're Medusa amongst a circle of your clan. Pick a Gorgon to look at, but be careful. If another Gorgon picks you to point her gaze, you'll both be turned to stone. Be the last Gorgon standing in the garden of statues  





### Goal
  
  
  
   The user tries to win the game by not being elimintaed when picking another Gorgon. A medusa can only be eliminated when each Medusa's selection is equal to eachother.  
   If you choose a Medusa and a Medusa chooses you, you and that Medusa are out.
